# Restaurant-Template

This personal project involves designing a one-page restaurant website that showcases various design concepts. The aim is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website that provides all the necessary information about the restaurant, such as the menu, location, and contact details, on a single page. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my design skills and create a website that effectively captures the essence of the restaurant's brand and style. The website design will be adaptable to different screen sizes, ensuring that it is accessible to all users regardless of the device they are using.
